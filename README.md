# Task 6 â€“ Password Security and Strength Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Evaluate passwords of different complexities using an online password strength checker and identify best practices for creating secure passwords.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/) â€“ Online password strength checker  
- Windows 11

## ðŸ§ª Passwords Tested

| Password Example         | Strength Score | Feedback |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| `password123`            | 15% (Very Weak) | Too common, short, predictable, lacks symbols |
| `Pass@2025`              | 55% (Medium) | Mix of case, number, symbol but still short |
| `M!cros0ft#Secure_2025`  | 85% (Strong) | Long, includes uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols |
| `MyDogRuns@5amEveryDay!` | 95% (Very Strong) | Passphrase style, long, highly unpredictable |

## ðŸ“Š Observations
1. Weak passwords are short, predictable, and often dictionary words.  
2. Adding complexity (uppercase, numbers, symbols) increases strength.  
3. Password length significantly improves resistance to brute-force.  
4. Passphrases combine memorability and strong security.

## ðŸ›¡ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** â†’ tries every possible combination.  
- **Dictionary Attack** â†’ uses a list of common passwords/words.  
- **Credential Stuffing** â†’ uses leaked credentials from other sites.  
- **Phishing & Social Engineering** â†’ tricking users into revealing passwords.

## ðŸ”‘ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1. Minimum of **12â€“16 characters**.  
2. Use **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters**.  
3. Avoid personal information (name, DOB, phone).  
4. Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `MyDogRuns@5amEveryDay!`).  
5. Donâ€™t reuse the same password on multiple accounts.  
6. Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.  
7. Use a **password manager** for generating & storing unique passwords.
